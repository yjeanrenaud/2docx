a simple converter for various file formats in order to use them with [https://github.com/pangaea-data-publisher/qualianon/ QualiAnon], which is currently only importing docx
## requirements
2docx is built upon java 8 by orcale. Because you need that runtime anyhow for QualiAnon.
## supported file types
currently 2docx supports txt, odt, doc and rtf as input file formats
## usage
whatever file/path/pipe you give as argument to the programme, it will convert to a docx-file of the same name
